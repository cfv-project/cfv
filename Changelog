2019-xx-xx - v2.0.0.dev2:
	* Now fully unicode aware.  Work is done internally in unicode, only translating to encoded form on input/output.
	* Added --encoding option.
	* Specifying --encoding=raw will allow working with broken filenames. (But really, you should just fix them, if possible.)
	* Torrent files now default to UTF-8 filename encoding, and specify the encoding field in the metainfo.
	* The encoding of text checksum files that start with a Unicode BOM is auto detected.
	* Python 2.3 is now the minimum supported version.
	* Decode the torrent comment field too.
	* Changed handling of -f: Now all options are checked before testing/creating the file. (Benjamin Hohl)
	* Torrent file handling no longer requires BitTorrent client to be installed.
	* Support for GNU coreutils sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum formats.

2009-06-07 - v1.18.3:
	* Fix python2.6 md5 and sha module deprecation warnings.

2008-06-22 - v1.18.2:
	* Print help output to stdout under non-error conditions. (Requested by Simon Howard)
 	* Work around mmap file descriptor leak in Python 2.4.2.
	* Support different module layout of BitTorrent 5.x.
	* Fix "struct integer overflow masking is deprecated" warning.  (Reported by jjacobs2)
	* Add --private_torrent flag. (Requested by Anders Henke)
	* Work around bug in Python (only manifests with 64-bit Python version >= 2.5) which causes checksums of files > 4GB to be incorrectly calculated (when using mmap, eg, when the progress meter is disabled or not shown.) 

2005-02-04 - v1.18.1:
	* Fix TypeError when using progress meter and checksumming stdin.
	* Fix progress meter spew when checksumming special files(devices, named pipes, etc.)
	* Sort list of checksum types in --help output.
	* Make -t help (or -t with unknown type) print list of types, with descriptions.

2005-01-11 - v1.18:
	* Added special hack for multi-file .torrents to automatically strip the first path component off if it doesn't exist. (Allows testing .torrent files within their dirs without having to manually do --strip=1)
	* Added .torrent creation support.
	* Fix testing torrents which contain large number of files giving "too many open files" errors.
	* Fix failure of -n in renaming bad files when testing a torrent file on windows due to windows not allowing renaming a file that is open.
	* Fix TypeError when using --progress=yes and not running under a tty and COLUMNS env var is set. (Reported by Steven Mueller)
	* Work around mmap error on large files. (Reported by Sapheriel)
	* Added sha1sum file support (-t sha1).

2004-07-10 - v1.17:
	* Handle .torrent files that have the creation date encoded as a string.
	* Handle .torrent files that specify the filename encoding.
	* Fix exceptions when trying to print unicode filenames containing non-ascii characters.
	* Add -s option to search for misnamed files.
	* Make .torrent support try BitTornado module if BitTorrent isn't found.
	* Fix --strippaths=0 handling of multiple leading slashes and of dos-style drive letters with forward slashes.
	* Improve handling of " and , in filenames in CSV files. (CSV parsing still won't be 100% correct, but doing any better would basically require adding a dependancy on some external csv module..)
	* Replace automagic buggy-quoting workaround with --unquote option, fixes --strippath handling of quoted filenames and avoids potential insanity with -n, -s, and quoted filenames.

2003-11-20 - v1.16:
	* Optimize progress meter display when checking lots of small files.
	* Add .torrent file support (requires BitTorrent.)

	* When following symlinks, don't die on cycles.
	* Ignore redundant FileDesc packets in PAR2 files.
	* Check that PAR2 files have FileDesc packets for every file listed in the Main packet.
	* Cache file checksums in memory in case they are verified by multiple checksum files.
	* -u now works correctly with deep checksum files.
	* -u option will now show dir/* if no files in a dir were verified. (--list=unverified still lists each unverified file.)
	* -uu can be used to force showing all unverified files.
	* Fix handling of the [files...] arguments in recursive test mode.
	* Add .p[0-9][0-9] (par1 recovery files) to the list of checksum file extensions to test automatically.
	* Fix FutureWarning "%X of negative int ..." on Python 2.3.
	* Add progress meter for file checksumming. (Can be toggled with the progress option.)
	* Only the new version 1.7 of fchksum module is supported.
	* Fix fixpaths option on windows.

2003-05-23 - v1.14:
	* Support md5sum files with comments in them.
	* Support PAR2 files.
	* Specifying -t in testmode without -f will cause cfv to only test files it finds if they are of the given type.
	* Doesn't try to test csv files with more than 4 fields as csv4 files.
	* Updated my email address.  The old one should still forward for about a year, but you should switch to using the new one when contacting me.
	* Support _cfvrc as an alternate name for .cfvrc.
	* Add win32src zip and win32 installer exe (using NSIS and py2exe).

2002-12-18 - v1.13:
	* Fix exception in test mode when specifying -t and -f with a non-existant file.
	* Add support for sfvmd5 files generated by some windows software. (Just a SFV formatted file using md5 checksums rather than crc32.)
	* Handle quoted paths and filenames in csv4 files.
	* Add filename_type .cfvrc option to allow user overriding of what type of checksum file to create when -t isn't specified and -f is.
	* Only print the md5sum "tested in textmode" warning once, and print a count at the end.

2002-09-23 - v1.12:
	* Fix make install when target directories don't already exist. (Reported by Svend S. Sorensen)
	* Fix cfv -u -t blah -f foo.blah from reporting foo.blah as unverified.
	* Make create mode also display seperate stats per checksum file. 
	* Make create mode be verbose in verbose mode.
	* Fix exception on error creating/writing a checksum file. (Eg, in a readonly dir, or a full drive.)
	* Accept files with weird line endings (eg \r\r\n).
	* Add support for (JPEG Sheriff format) .crc files.  (The dimensions column is only added if The Python Imaging Library is avialable.)
	* Fix printing incorrect paths for subsequent files in recursive mode after encountering a directory that could not be accessed.

2002-04-08 - v1.11:
	* Due to architectural changes, unicode requirements(for .par support), etc, cfv now requires python 1.6 or higher.
	* Add test-only support for PAR files. (python 1.6 or 2.2 recommended for better performance.)
	* Print first SFV comment line in testing from blah.sfv line.  (usually shows creating sfv program/creation time.)
	* Add --strippaths option. (Like patch's -p/--strip option.)
	* Revamp --showpaths option parsing, and add relative mode. (Note, auto-relative is now the default, to get the old behaviour specify "showpaths auto-absolute" in your .cfvrc)
	* Added cmdlineglob config option.
	* Added -Q command line arg to show only status lines.
	* Alternate method of setting verbose .cfvrc option (using command line verbosity option letter.)

	* Fix file.close() exception on -C in empty dir.
	* Add mmap support for faster checksumming when not using fchksum module.
	* Add CFV_NOFCHKSUM and CFV_NOMMAP env vars. (Mostly for testing/debugging.)
	* Handle files made by buggy programs that add quotes to filenames.
	* Print stats about number of case differences and quoted filenames.
	* In recursive mode, an unaccessible dir no longer causes an exception. (Reported by Harley Gorrell)
	* Fix excessive memory usage on deep recursive create mode in tree with lots of files. (Reported by Harley Gorrell)
	* Display seperate stats per checksum file, and (if needed) a total at the end.
	* In create mode, an already existing checksum file now causes a cferror, rather than an immediate exit.

2001-09-03 - v1.9:
	* Support bsd style md5 files (-t bsdmd5).
	* Make test.py not attempt to verify against md5sum if it is not available (ie, on bsd). (reported by Hannu Liljemark)

	* Extended --version output.

	* Added --help alias for -h.
	* Added --version. 

2000-11-19 - v1.7:
	* Made ignore case option always search for correct filename if using show unverified files mode.  Fixes problem with incorrectly showing some files as unverified on FAT drives.
	* Caches dir entries for much faster ignore case operation.
	* Accepts - to represent stdin for data source and/or stdout for destination of checksums.
	* Added -VV option.
	* Errors printed to stderr instead of stdout.
